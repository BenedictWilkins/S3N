# S3N

This repository contains supporting code for our paper [Anomaly Detection in Video Games](https://github.com/BenedictWilkinsAI/S3N). All of the models used in experiments can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/benedictwilkinsai/s3n-pretrained-models), see the starter kernel for how to load them without dependancies.

## Atari Anomaly Dataset (AAD)

Our dataset (AAD) was used to evaluate the performance of S3N, the dataset and more information can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/benedictwilkinsai/atari-anomaly-dataset-aad).
